# ADD FEED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I want to add my feed to the Planet Crustaceans.

## I checked the following required validations: (mark all 4 with [x])

1. [ ] My feed is valid, I checked using https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=MY_FEED_URL and it is valid!
4. [ ] I am aware that once my feed is added it can take a few hours to start being fetched (according to the server update cycle)

Thanks in advance for adding my feed to the planet! :+1:
